## Usage
To enable some of these alerts for your applications, you just need to replace  `App_1`, `App_2` and `App_3` with the actual names of your applications. You can refer to the Prometheus metrics to identify the available filters that can be used for each application. Additionally, modify the values in the conditions to reflect the real cases of your applications. These adjustments will ensure that the alerts accurately monitor your specific applications and their scaling needs.
